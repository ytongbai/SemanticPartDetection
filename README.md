## Highlight

- We present an approach which can learn from a small annotated dataset containing a limited range of viewpoints and generalize to detect semantic parts for a much larger range of viewpoints. 
- The approach is based on our matching algorithm, which is used for finding accurate spatial correspondence between two images and transplanting semantic parts annotated on one image to the other.



## Usage
Our code uses PyTorch to implement. 
Experiments are performed on the [VehicleSemanticPart (VSP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06855) dataset and synthetic images generated by [UnrealCV](https://unrealcv.org/). 
Please refer to these websites for details of data preparation.

- supports python3 and [pytorch=1.1.0](http://pytorch.org)

- need to install MATLAB

- clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/zhirongw/lemniscate.pytorch.git`

- Pipeline:

  - Generate synthetic data.
  - Get training images from different viewpoints.
  - Extract features from ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 Network.
  - Use maximal clique algorithm to conduct the matching stage.
  - Calculate mAP score.
